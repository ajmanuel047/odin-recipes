I stopped coding for quite some months due to unavoidable issues so I decided to 
start again with odin projects to quickly refresh my memory and rebuild my muscle
memory on some things I have probably forgotten about.

I would strickly stick to the lessons and this is the first project which would make
me quickly practice the html structure on a page and I am also doing this so I get 
comfortable with using the command line.
